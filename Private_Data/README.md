# Private data

We cannot release all our private data due to the copyright issues. Some data are contributed by our biological collaborators and we do **not** have the copyright of these valuable image data. We will try our best to provide more training data with annotations to the whole marine community. 

**We keep continuously uploading our new data, stay tuned!**

## The directory structure of private data is:
```
├──Private_Data
   ├── Fish_reid_OUC
       ├── README.md # provide further information
       └── xxxx.zip # the json zip for the instance mask annotations
   ├── YouTube_data
       ├── README.md
       └── xxxx.zip
   ├── ...
```

We provide corresponding `README.md` file under each folder to provide more information.
