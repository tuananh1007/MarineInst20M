# Animal Image Dataset

The images are from [Animal image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals). We only select the partial marine images for performing the annotation. In total, we have provided annotations (1,903 instance masks) for 954 images.

Images could be downloaded at: [selected animal images](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/evnkdk1ht29qamduur6er/images.zip?rlkey=qf210w3n9p5fsvyljmtp4we8z&st=iz6hwgyi&dl=0). 

We do not have the copyright of these images. If the images violated the copyright issue, we would remove the images immediately.

The mask annotations of the images are included in the `animal_image_dataset.zip`.
