The images are from [Kaggle Sea Animal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/sea-animals-image-dataste/data). We only select the partial marine images for performing the annotation. In total, we have provided annotations (7,448 instance masks) for 3,080 images.

After downloading the images, please run the following codes to do some post-processing to get the same images as our training images.

```python processing_seaanimal.py```

The annotations of the images are included in the jsons.zip.
