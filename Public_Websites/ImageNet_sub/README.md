# ImageNet

The images are from [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/). We only select the partial marine images for performing the annotation. In total, we have provided annotations (7,175 instance masks) for 3,987 images.

Images could be downloaded at: [selected marine images](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mwbm3wqrumyce20co3k9c/ImageNet_imgs.zip?rlkey=ak1kyypkjhi5v87do5fp9we1y&st=frizgrl2&dl=0). 

We do not have the copyright of these images. If the images violated the copyright issue, we would remove the images immediately.

The annotations of the images are included in the `jsons.zip`.
